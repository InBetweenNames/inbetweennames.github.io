Well, my old server's SSD finally died on me, and I figured this would make a good opportunity to update my blog!
Previously, this site was hosted on an ASUS AC-87U with an SSD attached using Grav.  It worked well enough,
although the installation process and setup was a bit slow and involved.  Since my last post, I've streamlined this
process considerably and am now using the Hugo static site generator to avoid the need for having PHP on the system.
Also, I'm using some beefier hardware now too!  We're now hosted on a Linksys WRT3200ACM in my apartment using OpenWRT.

More to come in the following days!

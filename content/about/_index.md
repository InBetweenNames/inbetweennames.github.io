Hi there! I'm Shane, a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Windsor.
I like to write here about the various projects I'm working on, hobby or otherwise.
My primary interests lie in Natural Language Processing, Heterogeneous Computing, and Virtual Reality,
although if you look at my publication record I'm actually kind of all over the place.

This blog is currently hosted on a Linksys WRT3200ACM router using OpenWRT.

This site uses [Matomo](https://matomo.org) for analytics.  It uses image-based cookie-less tracking with a Javascript helper.
The reason for this is to help me understand what content people are interested in.  I'm not interested
in any of your personal information, and all collected information is heavily anonymized.
What I'm interested in is how long it takes pages to load, which pages are being visited and when, and which
rough geographic region they're being visited from.

**This site respects the Do Not Track (DNT) setting in your browser.**

# Collection of Information
The following information is collected when you visit:

 * The first 2 bytes of your public IPv4 address

 * The titles and URLs of the pages you have visited
 * Your location (country, region, city)
 * Your time zone
 * Screen resolution
 * Link clicks to outside domains
 * Main language of the browser (Accept-Language header your browser sends)
 * User agent of the browser, which may include your Operating System, device used, brand and model

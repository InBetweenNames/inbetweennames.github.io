This site uses [Matomo](https://matomo.org) for analytics.  It uses image-based cookie-less tracking with a Javascript helper.
The reason for this is to help me understand what content people are interested in and how to better structure the site.  I'm not interested
in any of your personal information, and all collected information is heavily anonymized.
What I'm interested in is how long it takes pages to load, which pages are being visited and when, and which
rough geographic region they're being visited from.

I'll never share this information with any other entity.  The data is entirely
 under my exclusive control for the purposes outlined above.  No other organizations or entities will ever receive this information.
The information is not for sale, for rent, trade, etc.

**This site respects the Do Not Track (DNT) setting in your browser.  If you are using a form of adblock that also blocks
analytics, e.g. [UBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin),  you also won't be tracked.**

# Collection of Information

 * The first 2 bytes of your public IPv4 address

 * Your time zone
 * Screen resolution
 * Link clicks to outside domains
 * Main language of the browser (Accept-Language header your browser sends)
 * User agent of the browser, which may include your Operating System, device used, brand and model

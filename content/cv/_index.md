PhD in Computer Science (defended December 2020, graduating June 2021). 
Interested in heterogeneous compute, virtual reality, compilers, reverse 
engineering, natural language semantics, and related topics.  Very comfortable 
with low level programming, and experienced with SIMD/vectorization for 
optimization.  Strong background in GPU compute using OpenCL and CUDA.  Very 
comfortable with Linear Algebra and Computer Graphics. Extensive C++ knowledge 
and experience (C++98 through C++20).  Familiar with development workflows on 
Windows and various Linux environments using Visual Studio, GCC and Clang 
compilers.  Some experience with Software Reverse Engineering (using Ghidra and 
ollydbg), but very interested in learning more.  Keen ability to maintain and 
accelerate critical legacy code that has little or no associated documentation.
Maintainer of the GentooLTO project on GitHub.

I have also been a Khronos Group OpenCL contributor as part of being in the 
University of Windsor OpenCL Working Group.  In particular, I am listed as a 
contributor on the OpenCL 2.2 specification.

Interested in heterogeneous compute, virtual reality, compilers, reverse
engineering, natural language semantics, and related topics. Very comfortable
with low level programming, and experienced with SIMD/vectorization for
optimization. Strong background in GPU compute using OpenCL and CUDA. Very
comfortable with Linear Algebra and Computer Graphics. Extensive C++ knowledge
and experience (C++98 through C++20). Familiar with development workflows on
Windows and various Linux environments using Visual Studio, GCC and Clang
compilers. Some experience with Software Reverse Engineering (using Ghidra and
ollydbg), but very interested in learning more. Keen ability to maintain and
accelerate critical legacy code that has little or no associated documentation.
Maintainer of the GentooLTO project on GitHub.</p><p>I have also been a Khronos Group OpenCL contributor as part of being in the
University of Windsor OpenCL Working Group. In particular, I am listed as a
contributor on the OpenCL 2.2 specification.</p><p><strong>Published Dissertation Link</strong>: <a href=https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/etd/8531/>https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/etd/8531/</a><br><strong>Doctoral Thesis Demonstration (WebAssembly)</strong>: <a href=http://speechweb2.cs.uwindsor.ca/>http://speechweb2.cs.uwindsor.ca/</a><br><strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href=https://github.com/InBetweenNames>https://github.com/InBetweenNames</a></p><h1 id=education>Education</h1><ul><li><p><strong>Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Computer Science, University of Windsor</strong><br>(<em>January 2017 - June 2021</em>)</p><ul><li>Natural Language Semantics.
